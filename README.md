# Etch A Sketch

## What will the application does?

The application is a digital version of the drawing toy [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch). An Etch A Sketch consists of three components: two knobs, a canvas, and a stylus. The left knob moves the stylus left and right, while the right knob moves it up and down, depending on which way you **twist** them. The canvas displays what you draw, you can draw only with 2 coloursâ€”black and white. 

The functionality of the stylus is makes the Etch A Sketch unique from other drawing toys. First, the stylus cannot be lifted, your entire drawing is a single continuous line. However, the stylus can be moved in all directions with the knobs. Second, once you have advanced the stylus, you can not undo the change. When you're done with your drawing and want to restart, you can shake the canvas to get a blank canvas. 

The **digital** version is like the physical toy but better, because it has **extra** features. Like allowing you to make as many drawings as you want with no need to earse your drawing every time. It also allows you to see all your saved drawings. 

## Who will use it and Why is this project of interest to you?

The project is for anyone, especially for those who want be creative and draw in an unconventional and fun way. My motivation for creating this project is to make the toy more accessible and to add much needed features.
